# Analyze-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Data
# Introduction
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. I will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle(opens in a new tab) that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.

# Why this Project?
In this project, I will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

# What skills will I use?
The main goal of this project is for I to demonstrate your ability to:

interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, dropdowns, data validation, VLOOKUP).
analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.
